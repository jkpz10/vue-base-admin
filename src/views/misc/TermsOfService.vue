          other information contained on the media or any part of the

          refund is requested within 10 days &nbsp;of the Delivery Date. In such
          cases where a refund is approved, End User will return the unopened
          &nbsp;Hardware to the VitaCorpo distributor or reseller which ordered
          the product or directly to &nbsp;VitaCorpo if the End User made such
          order itself. If the Hardware was ordered by a distributor or
          &nbsp;reseller, such distributor or reseller will coordinate with
          VitaCorpo for the return of the Hardware. &nbsp;In either case, Customer
          is responsible for shipping and insurance charges and any damage to the
          &nbsp;Hardware which takes place en route to VitaCorpo. VitaCorpo
